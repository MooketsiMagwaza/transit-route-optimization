"""Idempotent scheduler for lifecycle jobs.

Each job has one owner (this process), a fixed interval, and a deterministic run ID derived from
the time slot. Because ``MaintenanceRun.run_id`` is unique, two replicas (or a restart in the
same slot) cannot run a job twice: the second attempt reports ``duplicate_skipped``.
Failures are recorded and retried on the next tick; a missed run raises an alert through the
``tsela_maintenance_*`` metrics.
